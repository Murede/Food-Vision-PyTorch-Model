    "**Machine learning model deployment** is the process of making your machine learning model accessible to someone or something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Someone else being a person who can interact with your model in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, someone taking a photo on their smartphone of food and then having our FoodVision Mini model classify it into pizza, steak or sushi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Something else might be another program, app or even another model that interacts with your machine learning model(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a banking database might rely on a machine learning model making predictions as to whether a transaction is fraudulent or not before transferring funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or an operating system may lower its resource consumption based on a machine learning model making predictions on how much power someone generally uses at specific times of day.\n",
    "\n",
    "These use cases can be mixed and matched as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a Tesla car's computer vision system will interact with the car's route planning program (something else) and then the route planning program will get inputs and feedback from the driver (someone else).\n",

    "## Why deploy a machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important philosophical questions in machine learning is:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/main/images/09-does-it-exist.jpeg\" alt=\"curious dinosaur often referred to as philosoraptor asking the question if a machine learning model never leaves a notebook, does it exist?\" width=300/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying a model is as important as training one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because although you can get a pretty good idea of how your model's going to function by evaluting it on a well crafted test set or visualizing its results, you never really know how it's going to perform until you release it to the wild.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having people who've never used your model interact with it will often reveal edge cases you never thought of during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what happens if someone was to upload a photo that *wasn't* of food to our FoodVision Mini model?\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution would be to create another model that first classifies images as \"food\" or \"not food\" and passing the target image through that model first (this is what [Nutrify](https://nutrify.app) does).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the image is of \"food\" it goes to our FoodVision Mini model and gets classified into pizza, steak or sushi.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if it's \"not food\", a message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if these predictions were wrong?\n",
    "\n",
    "What happens then?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how these questions could keep going.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus this highlights the importance of model deployment: it helps you figure out errors in your model that aren't obvious during training/testing.\n",

    "\n",
    "The overall premise of Gradio is very similar to what we've been repeating throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are our **inputs** and **outputs**?\n",
    "\n",
    "And how should we get there?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that's what our machine learning model does.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "inputs -> ML model -> outputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, for FoodVision Mini, our inputs are images of food, our ML model is EffNetB2 and our outputs are classes of food (pizza, steak or sushi).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "images of food -> EffNetB2 -> outputs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the concepts of inputs and outputs can be bridged to almost any other kind of ML problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your inputs and outputs might be any combination of the following:\n",
    "* Images\n",
    "* Text\n",
    "* Video\n",
    "* Tabular data\n",
    "* Audio\n",
    "* Numbers\n",
    "* & more\n",
    "\n",
    "And the ML model you build will depend on your inputs and outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradio emulates this paradigm by creating an interface ([`gradio.Interface()`](https://gradio.app/docs/#interface-header)) from inputs to outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gradio.Interface(fn, inputs, outputs)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where, `fn` is a Python function to map the `inputs` to the `outputs`.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Gradio provides a very helpful `Interface` class to easily create an inputs -> model/function -> outputs workflow where the inputs and outputs could be almost anything you want. For example, you might input Tweets (text) to see if they're about machine learning or not or [input a text prompt to generate images](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion).*\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** Gradio has a vast number of possible `inputs` and `outputs` options known as \"Components\" from images to text to numbers to audio to videos and more. You can see all of these in the [Gradio Components documentation](https://gradio.app/docs/#components)."

    "Our `app.py` script will put together all of the pieces of the puzzle to create our Gradio demo and will have four main parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports and class names setup** - Here we'll import the various dependencies for our demo including the `create_effnetb2_model()` function from `model.py` as well as setup the different class names for our FoodVision Mini app.\n",
    "2. **Model and transforms preparation** - Here we'll create an EffNetB2 model instance along with the transforms to go with it and then we'll load in the saved model weights/`state_dict`. When we load the model we'll also set `map_location=torch.device(\"cpu\")` in [`torch.load()`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html) so our model gets loaded onto the CPU regardless of the device it trained on (we do this because we won't necessarily have a GPU when we deploy and we'll get an error if our model is trained on GPU but we try to deploy it to CPU without explicitly saying so).\n",
    "3. **Predict function** - Gradio's `gradio.Interface()` takes a `fn` parameter to map inputs to outputs, our `predict()` function will be the same as the one we defined above in [section 7.2: *Creating a function to map our inputs and outputs*](https://www.learnpytorch.io/09_pytorch_model_deployment/#72-creating-a-function-to-map-our-inputs-and-outputs), it will take in an image and then use the loaded transforms to preprocess it before using the loaded model to make a prediction on it.\n",
    "    * **Note:** We'll have to create the example list on the fly via the `examples` parameter. We can do so by creating a list of the files inside the `examples/` directory with: `[[\"examples/\" + example] for example in os.listdir(\"examples\")]`.\n",
    "4. **Gradio app** - This is where the main logic of our demo will live, we'll create a `gradio.Interface()` instance called `demo` to put together our inputs, `predict()` function and outputs. And we'll finish the script by calling `demo.launch()` to launch our FoodVision Mini demo!"
